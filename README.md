# NONOGRAM!!!

This is a simple "copy" of the game Nonogram. 
Here is a [website](https://www.puzzle-nonograms.com/) that provides thousands of nonogram puzzles:

Now we wish to use pygame to build this game quickly, then we want to create an ai for this game. 



### Usage: 

python runner.py ./data/tree.txt



### Understand:

In our data files, we store the puzzle answer as txt files. For example, the palm.txt file.

In that file, "O" stands for cells that should be filled in, "X" stands for cells that should be marked as crosses. "#" is my special notation that stands for the prompted "X"s appear in the original puzzle. 

These prompts, however, seems to belong to [this specific game](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nonogram-com-number-games/id1452992954). But I don't see any prompt in those [online puzzles](https://www.puzzle-nonograms.com/).
